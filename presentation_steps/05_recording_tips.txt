# STEP 5: RECORDING TIPS

## Screen Recording Setup
1. Use screen recording software (Kazam, OBS, or built-in recorder)
2. Record at 1080p resolution for clarity
3. Capture all three windows:
   - Gazebo simulation
   - RViz visualization
   - Terminal output

## Recording Sequence
1. Start with Gazebo window showing the house layout
2. Show RViz window with robot model and sensors
3. Start navigation and record robot movement
4. Highlight key moments:
   - Robot detecting obstacles
   - Robot turning decisions
   - Smooth path following
5. Record terminal output showing log messages

## What to Narrate During Recording
1. "This is the HomeCleanerBot in a 2+1 house layout simulation"
2. "The robot uses LiDAR sensors for obstacle detection"
3. "When an obstacle is detected, the robot intelligently chooses the best direction to turn"
4. "The navigation algorithm maintains a safe distance from all obstacles"
5. "RViz provides real-time visualization of the robot's state and sensor data"

## Key Points to Highlight
- 2+1 house layout with realistic room arrangement
- Intelligent obstacle avoidance without collisions
- Real-time sensor data visualization
- Smooth robot movement and turning
- Integration between Gazebo, RViz, and navigation algorithms
