# STEP 6: CLEAN SHUTDOWN

## Stopping the System
To properly shut down the system:

1. In Terminal 3 (navigation):
   - Press Ctrl+C to stop the navigation script

2. In Terminal 2 (RViz):
   - Close the RViz window
   - Or press Ctrl+C in the terminal

3. In Terminal 1 (Gazebo):
   - Press Ctrl+C to stop the simulation
   - Wait for processes to terminate gracefully

## Alternative Quick Shutdown
If needed, you can kill all processes quickly:
```bash
pkill -f "launch_sim.launch.py"
pkill rviz2
pkill python3
pkill gazebo
```

## Verification
After shutdown, check that no ROS processes are running:
```bash
ps aux | grep -E "(ros|gazebo|nav2|slam)" | grep -v grep
```

This should return no results if all processes were properly terminated.
