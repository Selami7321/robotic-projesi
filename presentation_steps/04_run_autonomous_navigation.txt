# STEP 4: RUN AUTONOMOUS NAVIGATION

## Terminal 3 - Start Smart Navigation
```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
source install/setup.bash
python3 /home/selamicetin/Masaüstü/robot/src/auto_robot/scripts/simple_auto_nav.py
```

Expected output:
- Robot begins moving forward in Gazebo
- Terminal shows navigation status messages
- Robot intelligently avoids obstacles without collision
- Robot turns when obstacles are detected

## What to Observe:
1. Robot moves smoothly forward initially
2. When approaching a wall:
   - Robot detects obstacle via LiDAR
   - Robot stops forward motion
   - Robot turns in the direction with more space
   - After turning, robot continues forward
3. No collisions with walls or furniture
4. Intelligent path planning around obstacles

## Navigation Algorithm:
- Uses LiDAR data to detect obstacles in sectors (front, left, right)
- Maintains safe distance (0.6m) from obstacles
- State machine approach:
  * FORWARD: Move straight when path is clear
  * TURN_LEFT/TURN_RIGHT: Turn when obstacle detected, choosing direction with more space
- Turns for fixed duration (1.5 seconds) then resumes forward motion
